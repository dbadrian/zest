This project is just a personal fun project.
Its public, mostly for easier usage on my own end, but not with the intention of providing support, accepting pull requests, or likewise.
Why? Simply because I don't plan to actively monitor or develop this project. At the same time, I do not care to just breaking thing as I like...and ignoring the semver I'm using here.

Sorry, for now, this is how it is. I might, or might not, spend some time to clean up things.
Currently, I am adding some documentation, so maybe it becomes useful for someone else, although I doubt it.

Note: This repo most certainly contains some odd things, which you shouldn't do (coding wise). Basically anything in here, I used for the first time when I started this project ...and I experiment(ed) a lot.

## Why Zest?
I wanted to have a recipe app:
    * with multi-language recipe support and translations
    * version protocolled recipes
    * remote backend, and possibility for different frontend-solutions
    * all private. I don't want to have my family recipes shared randomly
    * also I wanted to store any recipes from the internet, while not violating copy-rights etc.
    * maybe more...mostly to learn... :)
