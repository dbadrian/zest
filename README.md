This project is just a personal fun project.
Its public, mostly for easier usage on my own end, but not with the intention of providing support, accepting pull requests, or likewise.
Why? Simply because I don't plan to actively monitor or develop this project. At the same time, I do not care to just breaking thing as I like...and ignoring the semver I'm using here.

Sorry, for now, this also doesn't get a License for various reasons.

Note: This repo most certainly contains many odd things, which you shouldn't ever do or try. Basically anything in here, I used for the first time when I started this project ...and I experiment(ed).
